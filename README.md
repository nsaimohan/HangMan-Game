Welcome to my Hangman Game project! This project was developed during my internship at codeAlpha as a Python Developer Intern.

## Project Overview

Hangman Game is a classic word guessing game where players have to guess the correct word by guessing individual letters within a limited number of attempts. The game provides an interactive and enjoyable experience for users while also challenging their vocabulary and guessing skills.

## Tools Used

- Python
- VS Code

## Features

- Random word selection for each game session.
- Interactive interface for user input and feedback.
- Visual representation of the hangman as the game progresses.
- Ability to track and display the remaining attempts.
- End game scenarios including win, loss, or quitting.
- Simple and intuitive gameplay suitable for all age groups.

## How to Play

1. Run the game using the provided instructions.
2. The game will randomly select a word, and you will be presented with a series of dashes representing each letter in the word.
3. Guess letters one at a time. If the letter is present in the word, it will be revealed; otherwise, your remaining attempts will decrease.
4. Continue guessing letters until you either guess the word correctly, run out of attempts, or choose to quit the game.
